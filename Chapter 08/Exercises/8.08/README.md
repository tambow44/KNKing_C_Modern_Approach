### Exercise 8.08
Write a declaration for a two-dimentional array named `temperature_readings` that stores one month of hourly temperature readings. (For simplicity, assume that a month has 30 days.) The rows of the array should represent days of the month; the columns should represent hours of the day.
### Solution
```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main(void)
{
   int temperature_readings[30][24];

   return 0;
}
```
