### Exercise 7.12
Suppose that `i` is a variable of type `int`, `f` is a variable of type `float`, and `d` is a variable of type `double`. Explain what conversions take place during the execution of the following statement:
```
d = i + f;
```
### Solution
First converting the `int` [`i`] to `float`; adding the sum of `i + f` [`float`]; converting the sum to `double` [`d`].
