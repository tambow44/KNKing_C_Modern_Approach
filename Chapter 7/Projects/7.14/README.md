### Project 7.14
Write a program that uses Newton's method to compute the square root of a positive floating-point number:
```
ENter a positive number: 3
Square root: 1.73205
```
Let `x` be the number entered by the user. Newton's method requires an initial guess `y` for the square root fo `x` (we'll use `y = 1`). Successive guess are found by computing the average of `y` and `x/y`. The following table shows how the square root of `3` would be found:

|x|y|x/y|Average of y and x/y|
|-|-|-|-|
|3|1|3|2|
|3|2|1.5|1.75|
|3|1.75|1.71429|1.73214|
|3|1.73214|1.73196|1.73205|
|3|1.73205|1.73205|1.73205|
