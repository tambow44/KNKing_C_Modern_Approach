 # KNKing_C_Modern_Approach
 My ***complete*** solutions to the exercises in K. N. King's "C Programming: A Modern Approach", second edition.

 ## Information

 All testing was done on CYGWIN_NT-10.0 3.0.6 x86_64, Compiling with clang v5.0.1+ . 
 The compiler has been set to run the C89 or C99 standard (per King's instructions).

 ```bash
 $ clang hello.c -o hello.o -Wall -Wextra -Wpedantic -std=c99
 ```
