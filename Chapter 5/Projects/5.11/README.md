### Project 5.11
Write a program that asks the user for a two-digit number, then prints the ENglish word for the number:
```
Enter a two-digit number: 45
You entered the number: forty-five
```
*Hint:* Break the number into two digits. User one `switch` statement to print the word for the first digit ("twenty", "thirty", and so forth). Use a second `switch` statement to print the word for the second digit. Don't forget that the numbers between `11` and `19` require special treatment.
### Solution
See `5.11.c` for complete code (omitted as it's quite large).
#### Output
```
Enter a two-digit number: 22
You entered the number twenty-two.
---
Enter a two-digit number: 10
You entered the number ten.
---
Enter a two-digit number: 19
You entered the number nineteen.

```
