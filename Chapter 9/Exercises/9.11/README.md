### Exercise 9.11
Write the following function:
```c
float computer_GPA(char grades[], int n);
```
The `grades` array will contain letter grades (`A`, `B`, `C`, `D`, or `F`, either upper-case or lower-case); `n` is the length of the array. The function should return the average of the grades (assume that `A = 4`, `B = 3`, C = 2`, `D = 1`, and `F = 0`).
### Solution
